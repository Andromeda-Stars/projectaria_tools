  gravity aligned world coordinate frame. The estimation includes pose and dynamics (translational

  Closed loop trajectories are fully bundle adjusted with detected loop closures, reducing the VIO
  drift which is present in the open loop trajectories. However, due to the loop closure
  correction, the “relative” and “local” trajectory accuracy within a short time span (i.e.
  seconds) might be worse compared to open loop trajectories.
